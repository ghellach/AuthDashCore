### 👋 Hey hey ! Welcome to AuthDash !

![AuthDash Logo](https://achrafghellach.ca/images/projects/png.png)

This project aims to create an authentication API in orer to make building a user management and authflow system easier for developers.

#### 📱 This project consists of :
- Full authentication webpages that are customizable
- Full access to each user's entry (document)
- Statistics utilities

#### 🧠 Project's context and idea structure:
An organization can create a cluster which contains applications. A cluster is the parent of the users. These users can login throughout an application auth system, which retrieves all it's data from the cluster database.

#### 📦 What I have done so far:
- User authflow
    - [x] Login
    - [x] Registration
    - [x] Email validation
    - [x] User status (active, unactive, suspended ...)
- Cluster Stats
    - [x] Ability to retrieve users and make some db operations that meet statistics purposes.
    - [x] CRUD onto the cluster
- Applications 
    - [x] Ability to CRUD applications
    - [x] Customization of authflow webpages (color, logo, names by languages)


#### 📝 TODO List:
- [] Continue cluster statistics
- [] Start NextJS frontend authflow for applications 
- [] Find some new ideas
- [] Make documentation for developers



##### I am open to everyone who wants to contribute to this project. Feel free to check it out ! Achraf Ghellach.
